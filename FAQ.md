# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## 1. What is this tool?
This is a preliminary screening tool designed to help you understand if you might meet the basic eligibility criteria for Social Security Administration (SSA) disability benefits (SSDI or SSI). It is based on publicly available SSA guidelines.

## 2. Is this an official assessment?
No. This tool is independent and not affiliated with the Social Security Administration. Only the SSA can make an official determination of your disability status.

## 3. Is my data safe?
Yes. Your data is extremely secure because it **never leaves your device**.
- We do not collect names, Social Security numbers, or addresses.
- All information you type is stored only in your browser's "Session Storage."
- As soon as you close your browser tab or window, all data is permanently deleted.

## 4. How does the tool calculate "Likely Allowance" or "Likely Denial"?
The tool uses a scoring system based on:
- **Age**: Older individuals (50+) often have different criteria under the SSA "Grid Rules."
- **Medical Conditions**: Certain severe conditions (like ALS or stage IV cancer) may qualify for "Compassionate Allowances."
- **RFC (Residual Functional Capacity)**: This determines the level of work you can still perform (Sedentary, Light, Medium, Heavy).
- **Education & Skills**: Your ability to transition to other types of work.

## 5. What should I do if the result is "Likely Allowance"?
If your result is positive, it suggests that based on the factors you provided, you may have a strong case. You should:
1.  Gather all your medical records.
2.  Speak with your treating physicians about your limitations.
3.  Apply directly at [SSA.gov](https://www.ssa.gov/disability).

## 6. What if the result is "Likely Denial"?
A "Likely Denial" result does not mean you shouldn't apply. Many cases are complex and depend on medical evidence that a simple screening tool cannot fully evaluate. Consider:
- Does your doctor believe you are unable to work?
- Has your condition worsened recently?
- Do you have multiple conditions that, when combined, prevent you from working?

## 7. How are dates formatted?
All dates in the application use the `mm/yyyy` (Month/Year) format. For example, January 2020 should be entered as `01/2020`. The tool will automatically add the slash for you as you type.

## 8. Can I use this tool if I am currently working?
Yes. However, the SSA has a "Substantial Gainful Activity" (SGA) limit. If you are earning more than a certain amount (updated annually), you may be ineligible regardless of your medical condition.

## 9. Is there a charge for using this tool?
No. This tool is completely free to use for anyone seeking information about disability eligibility.
